## Concepts to consider üëÄ

| Projects | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [IoT](https://youtu.be/QaTIt1C5R-M) | The Internet of Things is a new paradigm of the modern world which is the connection of several IoT nodes (things) that contain integrated sensors, actuators, gateways, platforms (software) and other components; to generate connections and exchange of information through the internet to later be processed with a purpose. At present, this concept is very ubiquitous (everyday) in the day to day, although it is not very perceived, since most of the things of daily use such as household appliances, cell phones, among other things; integrate it. (Xia, Yang, Wang, & Vinel, 2012), (CambioDigital, 2018). |
| [Data analytics](https://www.sas.com/en_us/insights/analytics/big-data-analytics.html)| Data analytics is the use of information that can be had or obtained digitally, in order to extract the best information in order to make the best decisions (Gibbs, 2012). |
| [Simulation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCMafswcNkY)| The simulation is an exact representation of the internal behavior of an event or phenomenon, designed to obtain the same result, characteristics, information, among others, consuming fewer resources than it would consume to run the real model, without having to carry out said event to obtain an analysis. or study of the result with less investment (Castellanos Hern√°ndez & Chacon Osorio, 2006). |
| [Emulation](https://youtu.be/mqZ8UU_3wgk)| Emulation is the imitation of the external part of a system in which the user will have the same experience as if it were the original system (Rold√°n Carrasco, 2007), due to this emulation only allows to give the experience of a system (fulfill its functions) without being. Unlike a simulator, the emulator must exactly imitate the external behavior of the original system, thus giving the user the original experience as if they were in front of the original system (Rold√°n Carrasco, 2007). |

| Niote document | In this file you can find all the information about this project, such as justification, objectives, scope and limitations, among other things. |
| Niote presentation | This workshop is about recursion and iteration, so, thanks to the supplied guide and the explanations provided by Professor Luis Eduardo Barreto, this could be developed. |
| NetIoTEmulator | This is the emulator that we are making, where you can find its structure, logic, among other things. |
